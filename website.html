    <h1> Biography </h1>
    <h2> Melanie Giler </h2>
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <p> I am a woman that <strong>codes</strong> and is learning more on coding; from Middle Village, NY. I am a rising junior entering Maspeth HS this fall. I am looking forward to applying to scholarship programs and visit colleges that interest me & my goals. In my free-time, I like to read and ride my bike and spend time with family.</p>
    <p> My dreams and aspirations is to travel the world and get a Phd as a degree in Biology. I wish to help others and make the world a better place as best as possible. So far, to accomplish this goal I have traveled to 3 countries and around 8 states; and am planning to visit Europe by next year. I have over 50 community service hours and plan to get around 100, I like to uplift those around me and place a smile on their faces.</p>
    <p> I have been in many sports and programs during my 16 summers, I've been in swimming, tap, ballet, taekwondo, gymnastics, art, basketball, soccer, field hockey, volleyall, piano, photography, and tennis. I've been in Key club and Hockey club; I've been in the program Embrace her Legacy and Girls who Code. I love to try new things and explore the possibilites out there. </p>
